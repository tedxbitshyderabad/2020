                Unaltered through time, very simply refers to any particular quality or idea which has stood the test of time.
                Anything the speaker, considers his/her core idea or value which has remained constant through the changing times, which have ultimately helped them attain their goal.
                We hope that the conveyance of this idea or value would help bring out stories of grit, strength, successes and failures which ultimately help our audience connect with the speakers and their ideas.
                With the wide range of speakers from varied fields and areas of interests, we are sure that each of our audience member would have form an individualistic interpretation of the idea which would further help in lively engagements and experiences.
                These are the diversity of the connections which we hope would help in strengthening our bond as a community.

                                Engineers turned fashion photographer. Born in Mathura. Born into a middle-class family. Growing up, wanting to become a painter,but neither it nor photography was considered financially viable career option by his father, thus ended up studying mechanical engineering. And fast-forwarding to the present moment, being awarded 'The fashion photographer of the year'and also being the first Indian to gain International recognition at the Hasselblad Masters Award. The first Indian whose work was chosen for the Swiss light manufacturer Broncolor’s annual calendar in 2012, which for the first time saw the calendar deviate from its standard imagery and print blurry fashion images. Featured in the Tank, Vogue, GQ, Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, Marie Claire, L’Officiel. Portfolio including Emirates, L’Oréal, Maybelline, Emmar, Adidas, Nokia, Motorola, Pepsi, Hutch, Nestlé, Sony, Nike, Reebok and Lakme. The journey in between was one filled with moments of helplessness, anger, self-doubt and everything more you could imagine, the feeling of no hope. But here's the man who fought it all and managed not to be quitessential. Photography in the fields of fashion was not believed to feed his family's stomach which he proved otherwise.
