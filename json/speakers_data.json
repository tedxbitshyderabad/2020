            "write_up" : "It has long been said that the world of stand-up comedy is kind to everyone other than the comedians. So why would the Executive Creative Director of one of the highest valued advertising firms in the American market decide to pull down the curtains and start doing something he’d never done?  Surprisingly, Neville Shah couldn’t answer this question himself when he began his journey to stardom.\nBeing a Mumbaikar, Neville says he missed out on seeing any “hasya kavis”, and the urge to bring that to his country may have sparked his new ambitions. It all began at a small event in the US where he was asked to perform a short three-minute set, where he was booed off stage, similar to his first few. However, as he discovered his space, he was able to pull the chip on his shoulder. His forte, as he describes it, is the ability to describe stupidity as seen through his lens by expressing his frustration about it in a crisp manner. And it should come as no surprise that he has results to show for it. His first breakthrough came with the nationwide tour of his standup “We Should All Kill Ourselves”. Seeing him becoming a comedy icon globally, Amazon signed him for their stand-up comedy specials along with 13 others, making him one of an elite group of comedians to become a household name in the country. \n“I’m so unfit, I don’t even walk into trouble”. \nThroughout the course of this journey, Neville has managed to run past, conquer and stand atop every goal he has set for himself. Trouble inevitable clawed at his advances, but he forged on. Time was cruel, and it took a while, but when he looks back at where he came from, he agrees he wouldn’t be the man he was today if not for the difficulties.",

In what would turn into a profound household name in the food-tech industry in India, revolutionizing the way people approach food and dining out - Dineout was born. The rising tide caught the nation by storm and lifted all metaphorical boats - the online platform and its array of services expanded rapidly and brought restaurant seats from close to 25,000 restaurants to over 50 million consumers across around 20 cities in the last year alone. \n\nAnkit - the CEO of the booming start-up enterprise has imbibed his principle stating that \"Small things make perfection but perfection is no small thing.\" The company - through its partnerships with Google Maps and other tech giants has been an inspirational success story towards the growing boom of start-ups in the country and Ankit has been at the forefront of that charge.",
